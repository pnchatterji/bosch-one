# Bosch One Installation Guide

Bosch One is integrated into a Zephyr and Nordic nrf Connect SDK installation as an external module. It is located in a directory named bosch-one in the Zephyr root directory.

Bosch One can be added to an existing nrf Connect SDK/ Zephyr installation, or it can be installed as the manifest repository, together with all dependencies.

## METHOD-1: Installing Bosch One as Manifest Repository

Before installing Bosch One, it is necessary to install the tools required by Zephyr and nrf Connect SDK for installation, such as Ninja, West, and Python. Please follow **Steps 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6** in the below link. Note that Zephyr or nrf Connect SDK have already been installed previously on the system, these tool would already be available and this step may be unnecessary.

[Installing nRF Connect SDK Manually](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started/installing.html#gs-installing)

**Do Not** carry out *Step 4*. It will be replaced by the procedure described below.

### Modified Step 4
Once the necessary tools are installed, Bosch One and its dependencies can be installed by opening a CMD console and typing the following commands:

These commands install Bosch One in a new directory named *bst* in the users's workspace along with the supported versions of nrf Connect and Zephyr, as well as other dependencies. If another location is desired, modify the following commands appropriately.

```
cd %HOMEPATH%
md bst
cd bst
west init -m https://github.com/BoschSensortec/bosch-one.git --mf west-ncs.yml
west update

```

Once the above command executes successfully, the following directory structure will exist in the user's Home Path:

```
  bst
  ├── .west
  ├── bootloader
  ├── bosch-one
  ├── modules
  ├── nrf
  ├── nrfxlib
  ├── test
  ├── tools
  ├── zephyr
```
### Update SDK and Tools Directories in VS Code

In order to develop Bosch One applications in VS Code, it is necessary to update the nrf Connect plugin SDK and Tools directory settings to point to the new Zephyr installation.

1. If VS Code with the nrf Connect plugin are not already installed, they can be installed as described here: 
[Installing VS Code with nrf Connect Plugin](https://nrfconnect.github.io/vscode-nrf-connect/get_started/install.html)
2. To make the directory settings, launch VS Code, launch the nrf Connect plugin and go to the *Quick Setup* dialog as described here:  [nrf Connect Quick Setup](https://nrfconnect.github.io/vscode-nrf-connect/get_started/quick_setup.html)
3. In the *Quick Setup* dialog box, set the *nrf Connect SDK* path to: *%HOMEPATH%\bst*, or whatever path was used in *Step 4*.
4. Set the *nrf Connect Toolchain* path to whatever path was used in *Step 6*.

## METHOD-2: Adding Bosch One to an existing nrf Connect / Zephyr installation

This method presumes there is already an existing and supported version of nrf Connect SDK/Zephyr in the user's workspace, and adds Bosch One external module to it.

Follow [nRF Connect SDK Getting Started](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_installing.html)
for details on how to setup nRF Connect SDK based projects, if not already available.

### Add *Bosch One* to the *nrf Connect* Zephyr manifest
Once nrf Connect SDK is installed, add the following entry to *ncs/vx.y.z/nrf/west.yml* 
at the end of the third-party projects section.
```
manifest:
  ...
  projects:
    ...
    # Other third-party repositories.
    ...
    - name: bosch-one
      path: bosch-one
      revision: main
      url: https://github.com/BoschSensortec/bosch-one
      import: bosch-one.yaml
```

NOTE: *revision:main* applies only for the currently supported version of nrf Connect. Refer compatibility-matrix.txt
for installing bosch-one for older versions of nrf Connect.

### Update the *nrf Connect* Zephyr module repository 

After adding bosch-one to the west manifest as above, open a Windows cmd console 
 and enter the following commands:

```
cd \ncs\vx.y.z
zephyr\zephyr-env.cmd
west update
```
If the update is successful, there should now be subdirectory named *bosch-one* under *ncs/vx.y.z/* containing the Bosch Sensortec Zephyr Drivers, Sensor API, Libraries, Documents and Samples.

**Notes:**
1. *vx.y.z* in the above description refers to version of *nrf Connect SDK* currently active in the *nrfConnect plugin*
in *VS Code*. E.g. *V2.3.0* Check the currently active SDK version in the *Welcome Page* of *nrf Connect Plugin* if you are not sure.
2. *zephyr-env.cmd* is a Zephyr script for setting the necessary environment variables for *west update* to function properly.
3. The above procedure has to be repeated every time a new version of *nrf Connect SDK* is installed
4. It is also necessary to update the settings of the *nrf Connect Plugin* in *VS Code* after updating the version of the 
*nrf Connect SDK*. This can be done in the *Quick Setup* in the *Welcome Page* of  *nrf Connect Plugin*.

## Use *Bosch One* to create a Zephyr application for Bosch Sensortec devices
Refer the sample readme files in *bosch-one/samples* to build a Zephyr application for a supported Bosch Sensortec device. Detailed documentation is available under *bosch-one/docs*

In summary, the general procedure is as follows:
- Launch VS Code
- Click on the nrf Connect plugin icon
- In the nrf Connect control pane, click on *Create a new application*
- In the New Application dialog box:
  - Select *Freestanding Application*
  - Select an appropriate location for the application, e.g. ncs/myapps
  - Select an appropriate bosch-one sample to act as template in the template field
  - Provide a name for the application
- A clone of the selected sample is created in the selected location
- Using the sample as base, create your own application
- Add a build configuration for the applicaton by clicking on the *Add Build Configuration* icon in the *Applications* sub-pane
- Select the desired bosch-one board in the *Board* combo-box (Refer next section if bosch-one boards are not visible)
- Add additional CMake arguments if required, as specified in the sample readme
- Enable Debug Options if debugging is desired
- Click on *Build Configuration* to build
- To flash and run, follow the instructions for the specific board, as described in the sample readme

## Using *Bosch One* boards in *VS Code*

The *bosch-one* specific boards defined in the boards sub-directory (e.g. bosch_app30 and bosch_nicla_sense) are automatically
integrated into the Zephyr build system after *bosch-one* module is installed as described above.

If these boards are not visible inside *VS Code* when creating a new build configuration, it may be necessary to do the following:

- Click on the *VS Code* Settings Icon at the bottom-Left of the window
- In the search box, enter *nrf-connect.boardRoots*
- Click on *Add Item*, and enter the following text:
```
${config:nrf-connect.topdir}/bosch-one/
```
- Click on OK
- The bosch-one boards should now be visible in the *Build Configuration* dialog box.
