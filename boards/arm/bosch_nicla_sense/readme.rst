Alternate Board Definition for Arduino Nicla Sense ME
*****************************************************

This board definition for Arduino Nicla Sense ME is pre-configured 
for Bosch Sensortec Drivers and the COINES library.

It is derived from arduino_nicla_sense_me.dts by Benjamin Bj√∂rnsson,
which is available in the upstream Zephyr repository.

All the Nicla samples in the bosch-one repository need to be built with 
this board definition, rather than with arduino_nicla_sense_me.
