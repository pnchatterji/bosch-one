description: Bosch BXX sensor 

compatible: "bosch,bxx"

#this device supports both spi and i2c interfaces, as configured in overlay
#this is the binding for i2c
#TIP: Add any additional parameters that are required for initializing the
#BXX device that need to be set in the board DTS overlay

        Interrupt Out pin of BXX. 
        TIP: Remove if no interrupt pin is available on BXX. This parameter is 
        optional in case an application does not require the interrupt feature. 
    csm-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false

        Chip Select pin is used as i2c/spi mode selector on most BST devices. On 
        some boards, it is directly wired to VDD to force i2c mode permanently. 
        If wired to a GPIO, it should be specified here. csm_gpios will be pulled 
        up at driver init if BXX device driver is on an i2c node in DTS 
    addr-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        SDO pin on most BST devices has a dual use as address selector in I2C mode,
        to select one of two I2C addresses. It may be hard-wired to VDD/Gnd on 
        some boards. In case it is wired to a GPIO, it can be specified here, and
        its desired state can be specified using addr-state. The i2c address specified
        in the DTS should correspond to the specified state.
    addr-state:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Desired state of address selector pin addr-gpios, 0 or 1. I2C address should
        correspond to this value
